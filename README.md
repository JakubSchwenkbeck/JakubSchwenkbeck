# Welcome to My GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently studying **Computer Science**, with a strong interest in technology and mathematics. I enjoy taking on new projects that challenge me, particularly in the areas of **Neural Networks**, **Server Development**, **Web Applications**, **Virtual Machines**, **Physics** and **advanced Mathematics**. My favorite tools include **Rust**, **MATLAB**, **Java**, **Python**, **Go** and **Julia**, but I'm always experimenting with new languages and concepts,fitting the current need for a Project.
