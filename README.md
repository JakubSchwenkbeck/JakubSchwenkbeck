# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! üëã

I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for exploring the depths of technology and mathematics. I enjoy working on projects that challenge my understanding and allow me to dive into areas like Neural Networks, Virtual Machines, and higher Mathematics. My current toolbox includes languages such as Rust, Python, Java, Haskell, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Projects

### Quantum-Computer-Simulation
A Rust-based quantum computing simulator where users can create and manipulate qubits, apply quantum gates (Hadamard, Pauli-X, Pauli-Z), and perform probabilistic measurements. Dive into the fascinating world of quantum computing with this simulator.

- **Technologies:** Rust
- **Topics:** Quantum Computing, Qubits, Bloch Sphere

### Riemann-Zeta-Function
This Python project visualizes key concepts related to the Riemann Hypothesis, focusing on exploring the Riemann zeta function in 3D. A mathematical exploration into one of the most famous unsolved problems.

- **Technologies:** Python
- **Topics:** Riemann Hypothesis, Zeta Functions, 3D Visualization

### Rust-VM
A 16-bit Virtual Machine written from scratch in Rust. This project includes virtual registers and simulates machine code level access, providing a hands-on approach to low-level programming.

- **Technologies:** Rust
- **Topics:** Virtual Machine, Backend

### Mandelbrot-Doc
HTML documentation for my Haskell Mandelbrot project, created using the Haddock Doc tool. This project serves as a companion to the Mandelbrot simulation.

- **Technologies:** HTML
- **Topics:** Documentation, Haskell, Mandelbrot

### Mandelbrot
Simulating the Mandelbrot set in Haskell using the Threepenny framework. This project includes HTML and CSS components for a complete browser-based experience.

- **Technologies:** Haskell
- **Topics:** Mandelbrot Set, Haskell, Threepenny

### Workflow-Manager
A Java-based app developed during a Computer Science lecture. It manages working hours, tasks, and projects with a CSV interface. The GUI is built using Java Swing.

- **Technologies:** Java
- **Topics:** Workflow Management, CSV Parsing, GUI

### Behavior-Classification-For-AV
An RNN-based project that classifies the behavior of objects in traffic based on risk, contributing to safer autonomous driving. This was part of a MATLAB challenge by MathWorks.

- **Technologies:** MATLAB
- **Topics:** Machine Learning, Autonomous Vehicles, RNN

### GameOfLife
A small coding project that simulates John Conway's Game of Life using Haskell. A simple yet intriguing exploration of cellular automata.

- **Technologies:** Haskell
- **Topics:** Game of Life, Cellular Automata

### Algorithm-Visualization
A fun project where I visualized sorting and search algorithms using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project combines coding with a visual representation of fundamental computer science concepts.

- **Technologies:** JavaScript
- **Topics:** Algorithm Visualization, Sorting, Searching

### Convolutional-Neural-Network
My first attempt at a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) written in Java. The CNN is trained with MNIST data to recognize handwritten digits from 0-9.

- **Technologies:** Java
- **Topics:** Neural Networks, CNN, MNIST Classification
