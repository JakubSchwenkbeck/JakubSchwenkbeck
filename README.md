# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for exploring the depths of technology and mathematics. I enjoy working on projects that challenge my understanding and allow me to dive into areas like Neural Networks, Virtual Machines, and higher Mathematics. My current toolbox includes languages such as Rust, Python, Java, Matlab,  Haskell, and more.
