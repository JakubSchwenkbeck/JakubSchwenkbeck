# Welcome to My GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently studying **Computer Science**, with a strong interest in technology and mathematics. I enjoy taking on new projects that challenge me, particularly in the areas of **Neural Networks**, **Virtual Machines**, **Physics**, and**advanced Mathematics**. My favorite tools include **Rust**, **Python**, **Java**, **Matlab**, and **C++**, but I'm always experimenting with new languages.
